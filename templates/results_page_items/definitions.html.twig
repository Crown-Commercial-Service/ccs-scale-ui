    <li><strong>Commercial agreement:</strong> 
        Commercial agreements contain a description of what's available, a list of suppliers who have been evaluated as capable against the requirements, and contract terms. 
        CCS has different agreements that cover different products and services.
        You can buy from a commercial agreement in various ways, such as direct award or by using a further competition among the suppliers listed, who will bid for the business.
    </li>

	<li><strong>Panel:</strong> A panel is the same as a commercial agreement, but what is available is relevant to solicitors firms.</li>

    <li><strong>Lot:</strong>
        Agreements are often divided into lots by product, service, region, or value.
        Which lot you use depends on what you need, who you are buying for, and your budget.
        For example, some lots may be better for educational institutions with a budget of under Â£1 million.
        Sometimes the lot you use has only one way to buy from it, for example you can only buy by using a direct award.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Further competition:</strong> A further competition helps you to compare suppliers in an open and fair way by inviting them to bid on the work you need doing. A further competition can take a few weeks to several months depending on how complex your needs are.
    </li>

    <li><strong>Direct award:</strong> A direct award is a way to award work to a chosen supplier on an agreement without the need to speak to other suppliers first. Further competition could represent better value for money, where both options are available.
